// work on your part
git commit -m "XXX"

git push // will prompt you to set upstream branch, do it

// open PR for your branch

// ping everyone iff all checks pass (all green)

// If you get a merge conflict (GitHub will tell you, red cross will appear)

git stash // only if you've local changes you still want to preserve

git checkout main && git pull

git checkout feature/XXX

git rebase -i main // place your changes ON TOP OF master branch

// pick all changes - in nano, just Ctrl-O, Enter, Ctrl-X

// rebase will stop as soon as merge conflict is detected. resolve it

// once rebase process is completed, compile and run - make sure all good

git branch // ensure you're on the feature branch that you just rebased against main
